Feature: Verification for Infrastructure Discovery and Monitoring
  As a Technology Architect
  I want to ensure infrastructure is completely discovered and monitored
  So that platform reliability and capacity planning are based on accurate data.

  Scenario: Infrastructure components are automatically discovered
    Given I have infrastructure discovery and monitoring tools
    When I analyze infrastructure inventory completeness
    Then 98% of infrastructure components should be automatically discovered
    And resource utilization should be monitored in real-time
    And capacity planning data should be current and actionable
    And infrastructure health should be continuously assessed

  Scenario: Performance and compliance monitoring is comprehensive
    Given I have performance monitoring and compliance scanning tools
    When I validate monitoring coverage
    Then all critical infrastructure should have performance monitoring
    And security compliance should be continuously assessed
    And disaster recovery capabilities should be regularly tested
    And infrastructure changes should be tracked and auditable
