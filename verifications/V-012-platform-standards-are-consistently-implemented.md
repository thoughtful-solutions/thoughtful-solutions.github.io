# V: Platform standards are consistently implemented

(Verification that infrastructure follows naming conventions, deployment patterns are consistent, monitoring is standardized, and automation is implemented for common tasks.)

Feature: Verification for Platform Standards Implementation
  As a Technology Architect
  I want to ensure platform standards are consistently implemented
  So that infrastructure is predictable, maintainable, and efficiently operated.

  Scenario: Naming conventions and standards compliance
    Given I have infrastructure configuration and deployment data
    When I analyze platform standards compliance
    Then infrastructure should follow enterprise naming conventions
    And deployment patterns should be consistent across environments
    And monitoring should be standardized with common tooling and practices
    And configuration management should be automated and version controlled

  Scenario: Automation and operational efficiency
    Given I have infrastructure as code and automation tool data
    When I validate automation implementation
    Then common infrastructure tasks should be automated
    And infrastructure provisioning should use infrastructure as code
    And operational runbooks should be automated where possible
    And platform self-service capabilities should be available for development teams
