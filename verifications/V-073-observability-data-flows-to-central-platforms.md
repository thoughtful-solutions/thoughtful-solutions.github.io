# V: Observability data flows to central platforms

(Verification that observability data flows to central platforms with automated testing and continuous monitoring.)

## Gherkin Verification

```gherkin
Feature: Verification for Centralized Observability
  As a Site Reliability Engineer
  I want to verify observability is comprehensive
  So that we can detect and resolve issues quickly

  Scenario: Metrics collection is comprehensive
    Given I have access to metrics platforms
    When I audit metric collection coverage
    Then 100% of services should emit standard metrics
    And custom business metrics should be defined for each service
    And metric retention should meet compliance requirements

  Scenario: Logging pipeline is functioning
    Given I have access to centralized logging systems
    When I verify log ingestion and processing
    Then all applications should send logs to central platform
    And log ingestion lag should be below 30 seconds
    And log retention should comply with data policies

  Scenario: Distributed tracing enables debugging
    Given I have access to tracing systems
    When I analyze trace coverage
    Then 95% of requests should have complete traces
    And trace sampling should capture anomalies
    And p99 trace storage latency should be below 5 seconds
