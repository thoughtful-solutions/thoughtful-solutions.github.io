Feature: Verification for Enterprise Data Model Coverage
  As a Data Architect
  I want to ensure the enterprise data model covers all business entities
  So that data architecture supports all business requirements effectively.

  Scenario: Business-critical entities are modeled at all levels
    Given I have access to database schemas and data models
    When I analyze data model coverage
    Then all business-critical entities should have conceptual models
    And logical data models should include detailed attributes and relationships
    And physical models should exist for all implemented entities
    And data quality rules should be defined for master data

  Scenario: Data model currency and accuracy
    Given I have database schema analysis tools
    When I query information schema across all databases
    Then data models should reflect current database structures
    And schema changes should be reflected in documentation within 24 hours
    And data relationships should be validated against foreign key constraints
