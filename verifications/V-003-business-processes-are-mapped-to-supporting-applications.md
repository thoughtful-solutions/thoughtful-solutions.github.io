Feature: Verification for Business Process to Application Mapping
  As an Enterprise Architect
  I want to ensure business processes are mapped to supporting applications
  So that digital transformation initiatives are properly scoped and prioritized.

  Scenario: Critical processes have application support documented
    Given I have business process models and application inventory
    When I analyze process-application relationships
    Then all critical business processes should have identified supporting applications
    And user journeys should be traceable through application touchpoints
    And process automation opportunities should be identified
    And redundant application support should be flagged for optimization

  Scenario: Process support mapping is current
    Given I have access to user activity analytics and audit logs
    When I analyze actual system usage patterns
    Then process-application mappings should reflect actual usage
    And performance bottlenecks should be identified
    And user experience issues should be documented
