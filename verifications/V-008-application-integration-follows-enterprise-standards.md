# V: Application integration follows enterprise standards

(Verification that application integrations use approved patterns, APIs are documented, service interactions follow standards, and integration monitoring is active.)

## Gherkin Verification

```gherkin
Feature: Verification for Application Integration Standards Compliance
  As an Application Architect
  I want to ensure application integrations follow enterprise standards
  So that integration complexity is minimized and maintainability is maximized.

  Scenario: API documentation and standards compliance
    Given I have access to API management platforms and service registries
    When I analyze API catalog completeness
    Then all public APIs should be documented with OpenAPI specifications
    And API endpoints should follow enterprise naming conventions
    And service interactions should use approved integration patterns
    And API usage and performance should be monitored continuously

  Scenario: Integration patterns follow enterprise architecture principles
    Given I have service mesh and integration platform data
    When I validate integration implementations
    Then point-to-point integrations should be minimized
    And event-driven patterns should be used for asynchronous communication
    And integration security should follow zero-trust principles
    And service level agreements should be defined and monitored
