# V: Service modularity enables independent deployment

(Verification that service modularity enables independent deployment with automated testing and continuous monitoring.)

## Gherkin Verification

```gherkin
Feature: Verification for Service Modularity
  As a Service Owner
  I want to verify services are truly modular
  So that teams can deploy independently

  Scenario: Services have no shared databases
    Given I have database connection configurations
    When I analyze database access patterns
    Then each service should have its own database schema
    And cross-service database joins should not exist
    And data sharing should occur only through APIs

  Scenario: API contracts enable independence
    Given I have API specifications and consumer data
    When I analyze service dependencies
    Then all APIs should have versioned contracts
    And breaking changes should require version increments
    And consumers should specify accepted versions

  Scenario: Deployment independence is demonstrated
    Given I have deployment history for the last quarter
    When I analyze deployment patterns
    Then 95% of deployments should involve single services
    And coordinated deployments should be below 5%
    And service downtime should not affect other services
```
