# V: Efficiency metrics demonstrate optimization

(Verification that efficiency metrics demonstrate optimization with automated testing and continuous monitoring.)

## Gherkin Verification

```gherkin
Feature: Verification for Operational Efficiency
  As an Operations Manager
  I want to verify systems operate efficiently
  So that we minimize waste and maximize value delivery

  Scenario: Resource utilization is optimized
    Given I have infrastructure monitoring data
    When I analyze resource utilization patterns
    Then average CPU utilization should be between 40-70%
    And memory utilization should be between 50-80%
    And no resources should be idle for more than 7 days

  Scenario: Cost per transaction remains competitive
    Given I have cost allocation and transaction data
    When I calculate unit economics
    Then cost per transaction should decrease 10% year-over-year
    And infrastructure costs should scale sublinearly with load
    And unused reserved capacity should be below 20%

  Scenario: Automation reduces manual effort
    Given I have operational task logs and automation metrics
    When I analyze manual vs automated task execution
    Then 90% of routine tasks should be automated
    And manual interventions should decrease 20% quarterly
    And human error incidents should be below 5% of total
