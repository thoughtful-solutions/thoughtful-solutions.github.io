# V: Data flows are documented and monitored

(Verification that data integration patterns, ETL processes, and data movement between systems are documented with automated monitoring and data lineage tracking.)

Feature: Verification for Data Flow Documentation and Monitoring
  As a Data Architect
  I want to ensure data flows are documented and monitored
  So that data integrity and compliance requirements are met.

  Scenario: Data integration processes are documented
    Given I have access to ETL tools and data pipeline configurations
    When I analyze data flow documentation
    Then all production data flows should be documented
    And data lineage should be traceable from source to consumption
    And data transformation rules should be clearly defined
    And integration patterns should follow enterprise standards

  Scenario: Data flow monitoring is active
    Given I have data pipeline monitoring tools
    When I check data flow health and performance
    Then all critical data flows should have active monitoring
    And data quality checks should be implemented at key points
    And performance metrics should be collected and analyzed
    And alerts should be configured for data flow failures
