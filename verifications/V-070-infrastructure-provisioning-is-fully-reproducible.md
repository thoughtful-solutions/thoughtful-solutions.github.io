Feature: Verification for Infrastructure Reproducibility
  As an Infrastructure Engineer
  I want to ensure all infrastructure is reproducible
  So that we can rebuild environments reliably

  Scenario: Infrastructure as Code covers all resources
    Given I have access to infrastructure repositories
    When I audit infrastructure coverage
    Then 100% of production infrastructure should be defined in code
    And all IaC should be version controlled
    And manual infrastructure changes should be blocked

  Scenario: Environment parity is maintained
    Given I have infrastructure configurations for all environments
    When I compare dev, staging, and production
    Then configurations should differ only in scaling parameters
    And security policies should be consistent across environments
    And drift detection should run daily with zero tolerance

  Scenario: Disaster recovery validates reproducibility
    Given I have disaster recovery test results
    When I review the last DR exercise
    Then full environment rebuild should complete within RTO
    And rebuilt environment should pass all smoke tests
    And data restoration should meet RPO requirements
