# V: Technology choices follow proven patterns

(Verification that technology choices follow proven patterns with automated testing and continuous monitoring.)

## Gherkin Verification

```gherkin
Feature: Verification for Technology Maturity
  As a Technology Architect
  I want to ensure we use proven technologies
  So that we minimize risk and maximize reliability

  Scenario: Technology stack uses mature components
    Given I have the technology inventory and adoption metrics
    When I analyze technology maturity levels
    Then 80% of technologies should be in "adopt" or "trial" phase
    And no production systems should use "assess" phase technologies
    And deprecated technologies should have migration plans

  Scenario: Industry adoption validates choices
    Given I have industry research and benchmark data
    When I compare our stack to industry standards
    Then core technologies should appear in top quartile of surveys
    And each technology should have 3+ years of production use
    And vendor/community support should be actively maintained

  Scenario: Reference architectures guide implementation
    Given I have architecture decision records
    When I review technology selection rationale
    Then each technology should reference proven patterns
    And implementation should follow vendor best practices
    And deviations from reference architecture should be documented
