Feature: Verification for Value Stream Architecture Coverage
  As an Enterprise Architect
  I want to ensure value streams cover all stakeholder journeys
  So that value delivery is optimized across the enterprise.

  Scenario: Customer-facing value streams are documented
    Given I have access to value stream maps
    When I validate stakeholder touchpoints
    Then all customer-facing value streams should be documented
    And each value stream should have defined start and end points
    And stakeholder roles should be clearly identified
    And value delivery metrics should be measurable and current

  Scenario: Value stream performance is tracked
    Given I have CRM and ERP system access
    When I analyze transaction and process data
    Then value stream metrics should be automatically collected
    And performance against targets should be measurable
    And bottlenecks and improvement opportunities should be identified
