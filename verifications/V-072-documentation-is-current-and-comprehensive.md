# V: Documentation is current and comprehensive

(Verification that documentation is current and comprehensive with automated testing and continuous monitoring.)

## Gherkin Verification

```gherkin
Feature: Verification for Documentation Quality
  As a Technical Writer
  I want to ensure documentation meets standards
  So that systems are maintainable and supportable

  Scenario: Documentation completeness check
    Given I have access to all repositories and wikis
    When I audit documentation coverage
    Then every service should have README with setup instructions
    And API documentation should be 100% complete
    And architecture decision records should exist for key decisions

  Scenario: Documentation currency validation
    Given I have documentation and code repositories
    When I check documentation timestamps against code changes
    Then documentation updates should occur within 24 hours of code changes
    And no documentation should be older than 6 months
    And automated API docs should regenerate on each deployment

  Scenario: Documentation usability testing
    Given I have documentation feedback and support tickets
    When I analyze documentation effectiveness
    Then new team members should successfully onboard using docs alone
    And documentation-related support tickets should be below 10%
    And documentation should have a feedback mechanism with <48hr response
```
