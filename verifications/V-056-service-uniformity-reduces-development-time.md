Feature: Verification for Service Uniformity Benefits
  As a Development Team Lead
  I want to verify that service uniformity accelerates delivery
  So that we can demonstrate ROI from standardization efforts

  Scenario: Template adoption reduces service creation time
    Given I have metrics from the last 12 months of service creation
    When I compare template-based vs custom service development
    Then template-based services should deploy 50% faster
    And template-based services should require 40% less code
    And onboarding time for new developers should be under 2 days

  Scenario: Standardized patterns reduce defect rates
    Given I have defect tracking data for all services
    When I analyze defect rates by service type
    Then services using standard patterns should have 60% fewer defects
    And critical production issues should be 75% lower
    And mean time to resolution should be 40% faster

  Scenario: Reusable components eliminate duplication
    Given I have code analysis reports for all repositories
    When I scan for code duplication across services
    Then code duplication should be below 5%
    And 80% of services should use shared libraries
    And common functionality should exist in only one location
