Feature: Verification for Simplicity Metrics
  As an Enterprise Architect
  I want to ensure systems maintain simplicity thresholds
  So that technical debt remains manageable and systems are maintainable

  Background:
    Given I have access to code analysis tools
    And I have access to service dependency graphs
    And complexity thresholds are defined in architecture standards

  Scenario: Code complexity remains within acceptable limits
    Given I analyze the codebase for all production services
    When I calculate cyclomatic complexity metrics
    Then 95% of methods should have complexity below 10
    And no method should have complexity above 20
    And the average complexity per module should be below 6

  Scenario: Service dependencies are minimized
    Given I have the complete service dependency map
    When I analyze service interconnections
    Then no service should have more than 5 direct dependencies
    And circular dependencies should not exist
    And the average service coupling should be below 0.3

  Scenario: Documentation complexity is appropriate
    Given I have all technical documentation
    When I analyze readability scores using automated tools
    Then documentation should have a Flesch Reading Ease score above 30
    And diagrams should use standard notation (UML, BPMN, ArchiMate)
    And each component should have a one-page architecture summary
