Feature: Verification for Application Business Process Support
  As an Application Architect
  I want to ensure applications effectively support business processes
  So that business productivity and user satisfaction are maximized.

  Scenario: User experience and performance meet requirements
    Given I have user analytics and application performance monitoring data
    When I analyze application effectiveness in supporting business processes
    Then user satisfaction scores should meet established thresholds
    And application response times should meet service level requirements
    And process automation opportunities should be identified and prioritized
    And user journey bottlenecks should be documented and addressed

  Scenario: Business process digital support is optimal
    Given I have process mining and user activity data
    When I validate digital process support
    Then manual workarounds should be minimized
    And process straight-through rates should meet targets
    And exception handling should be automated where appropriate
    And business process metrics should show continuous improvement
