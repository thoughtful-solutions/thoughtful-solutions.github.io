Feature: Verification for Security Architecture Implementation
  As a Technology Architect
  I want to ensure security architecture is properly implemented and current
  So that enterprise security posture meets requirements and regulatory obligations.

  Scenario: Security controls are implemented and effective
    Given I have security scanning and monitoring tools
    When I validate security control implementation
    Then security policies should be implemented across all systems
    And access controls should be enforced according to least privilege principles
    And vulnerability management should be active with defined SLAs
    And security incidents should be detected and responded to appropriately

  Scenario: Compliance and security monitoring is continuous
    Given I have compliance monitoring and security information systems
    When I check security architecture compliance
    Then compliance status should be current for all applicable regulations
    And security metrics should be collected and analyzed continuously
    And security architecture should be reviewed and updated regularly
    And security awareness and training should be current for all personnel
