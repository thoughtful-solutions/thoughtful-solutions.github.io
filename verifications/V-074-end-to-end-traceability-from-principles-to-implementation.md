# V: End to end traceability from principles to implementation

(Verification that end to end traceability from principles to implementation with automated testing and continuous monitoring.)

## Gherkin Verification

```gherkin
Feature: Verification for Architecture Traceability
  As an Enterprise Architect
  I want to verify complete traceability exists
  So that we can demonstrate architecture value

  Scenario: Principles trace to implementation
    Given I have the complete architecture repository
    When I trace from principles to code
    Then every principle should link to supporting rules
    And every rule should have verification tests
    And verification tests should execute in CI/CD

  Scenario: Business capabilities map to services
    Given I have capability models and service catalogs
    When I analyze capability coverage
    Then every business capability should map to services
    And service ownership should align with capability ownership
    And capability KPIs should be measurable through service metrics

  Scenario: Compliance evidence is traceable
    Given I have compliance requirements and test results
    When I generate compliance reports
    Then every requirement should map to controls
    And controls should have automated verification
    And evidence should be timestamped and immutable
