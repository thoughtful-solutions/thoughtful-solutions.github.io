Feature: Verification for Deployment Agility
  As a DevOps Engineer
  I want to verify our deployment agility meets targets
  So that we can respond quickly to business needs

  Scenario: Deployment frequency meets agility targets
    Given I have deployment metrics from CI/CD pipelines
    When I analyze deployment frequency by environment
    Then production deployments should occur at least daily
    And staging deployments should occur multiple times per day
    And hotfix deployments should complete within 1 hour

  Scenario: Rollback capability ensures rapid recovery
    Given I have deployment and incident history
    When I analyze rollback scenarios from the last quarter
    Then 100% of services should support automated rollback
    And rollback should complete within 5 minutes
    And rollback success rate should be above 99%

  Scenario: Feature flags enable progressive delivery
    Given I have feature flag management system data
    When I analyze feature release patterns
    Then 80% of new features should use feature flags
    And features should be testable in production before full release
    And flag changes should take effect within 60 seconds
