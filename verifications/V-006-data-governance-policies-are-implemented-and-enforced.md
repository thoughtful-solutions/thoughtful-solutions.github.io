Feature: Verification for Data Governance Implementation
  As a Data Architect
  I want to ensure data governance policies are implemented and enforced
  So that data quality, security, and compliance requirements are met.

  Scenario: Data governance roles and responsibilities are assigned
    Given I have access to data governance documentation
    When I validate stewardship assignments
    Then data stewards should be assigned to all critical data domains
    And stewardship responsibilities should be clearly documented
    And escalation procedures should be defined
    And governance performance should be measured and reported

  Scenario: Data access controls and quality monitoring are active
    Given I have access to database security and monitoring systems
    When I check data governance implementation
    Then access controls should be implemented according to data classification
    And data quality monitoring should be active for critical datasets
    And compliance reporting should be automated where possible
    And policy violations should trigger appropriate alerts and responses
