* **Provide** a blueprint for a cohesive portfolio of applications that support business capabilities and processes.
* **Ensure** direct alignment between the application portfolio and the goals of the Business Architecture.
* **Define** how applications interact with each other and consume data from the Data Architecture.
* **Guide** the rationalization, integration, and evolution of the application landscape to reduce redundancy and maximize business value.

## Scope

* **Portfolio & Services**
  * The portfolio of applications and systems required to support business functions and process data.
  * The definition of application services that are provided to the business.
