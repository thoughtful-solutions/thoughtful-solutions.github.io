# D: Data Architecture

## Definition

Data Architecture defines the structure, management, and governance of an organization's data assets. It provides the models, policies, and standards that govern how data is collected, stored, arranged, used, and removed, ensuring it is a shared and reliable asset for the enterprise.

## Purpose

* **Define** and structure all logical and physical data assets to treat data as a strategic resource.
* **Ensure** that data is managed in a way that directly supports the information needs of the Business Architecture.
* **Provide** applications with consistent, secure, and reliable data, forming a stable foundation for the Application Architecture.
* **Establish** enterprise-wide standards for data interoperability, reusability, quality, and security.

## Scope

* **Data Structure & Models**
    * Data models defining relationships, semantics, and standards.
    * The definition of data entities and components at conceptual, logical, and physical levels.
* **Data Flow & Lifecycle**
    * The complete data lifecycle, from creation and usage to storage and deletion.
    * Data flows and the integration of data across different systems and processes.
* **Data Governance & Management**
    * Data governance and stewardship practices.
    * Policies governing data quality, security, and access control.
    * The management of all enterprise metadata.
