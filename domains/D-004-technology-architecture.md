# D: Technology Architecture

## Definition

Technology Architecture describes the underlying platform of software, hardware, and network infrastructure needed to build, deploy, run, and manage applications. It defines the standards and patterns for the technology components that enable the Data, Application, and Business Architectures.

## Purpose

* **Define** the underlying technology platform (hardware, software, and networks) that enables the Application and Data Architectures.
* **Ensure** that the technology platform is scalable, reliable, secure, and portable enough to meet business requirements.
* **Govern** technology choices to align with strategic business needs and architectural standards.
* **Provide** a stable foundation for infrastructure planning, deployment, and IT operations.

## Scope

* **Infrastructure & Hosting**
    * Core computing infrastructure, including servers, storage, and processing environments.
    * Networking and communications infrastructure, covering LAN, WAN, cloud, and mobile connectivity.
    * Hosting and deployment environments such as data centres, cloud services, virtualization, and containers.
* **Platforms & Middleware**
    * Middleware platforms that enable integration, including service buses, messaging, and APIs.
* **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
    * Technology standards, principles, and interoperability requirements.
    * Security infrastructure for identity, access control, encryption, and monitoring.
    * Tools for IT operations and management, including monitoring, automation, and disaster recovery.

## Deliverables

* **Technology Infrastructure Architecture** - Current and target state infrastructure design
* **Cloud & Hosting Strategy** - Platform recommendations and migration roadmap
* **Integration Platform Architecture** - Middleware and API management platform
* **Enterprise Security Architecture** - Security framework and implementation standards

## Data Sources

* **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform/Ansible configurations for current state
* **Cloud Provider APIs** - Resource inventory and utilization metrics
* **Network Discovery Tools** - Topology mapping and connectivity analysis
* **Performance Monitoring** - System metrics, capacity utilization, health status
* **Security Scanning Tools** - Compliance status, vulnerability assessments
