Enterprise Architecture CLI Managerea\_cli.py is a command-line tool for managing Enterprise Architecture (EA) artifacts like Principles, Rules, Domains, and Verifications. It helps maintain a structured, version-controlled repository of your architecture documentation.FeaturesCRUD Operations: Create, show, update, and delete artifacts.Linkage Management: Link and unlink artifacts to define relationships.Validation: A powerful validator checks for untracked files, broken links, and content compliance.Scaffolding: An init command to create a fully populated repository with best-practice examples.Visualization: Automatically generate relationship diagrams in Mermaid (graphical) or Markdown (text) format.Configurable: Use spec.yaml files to define artifact templates and content validation rules.SetupPrerequisites: Python 3.7+Install Dependencies:Create a requirements.txt file with the content below and run:pip install -r requirements.txt

Make the script executable:chmod +x ea\_cli.py

Step-by-Step Demo: Adding a New VerificationThis tutorial demonstrates the end-to-end workflow for adding a new verification to an existing principle.Step 1: Initialize the RepositoryIf you haven't already, start by creating the complete directory structure and populating it with the default artifacts../ea\_cli.py init

Step 2: Create a New Verification ArtifactLet's create a verification for the "Simplicity" principle. The goal of this verification is to ensure that the architecture is not overly complex by limiting the number of rules../ea\_cli.py create verification "Simplicity principle is verified by a low rule count" --moscow Must

The tool will create a new file, for example: verifications/V-001-simplicity-principle-is-verified-by-a-low-rule-count.md.Step 3: Add Content to the ArtifactOpen the newly created file (verifications/V-001-...md) in a text editor and add the specific Gherkin syntax for the verification test.Feature: Verification for Simplicity Principle (AP-001)

&nbsp; As an Enterprise Architect

&nbsp; I want to ensure the number of architectural rules is minimal

&nbsp; So that the architecture remains simple and easy to understand.



&nbsp; Scenario: Count the number of active architectural rules

&nbsp;   Given I have access to the architecture repository

&nbsp;   When I count the number of files in the 'rules' directory

&nbsp;   Then the total number should be less than 10

Step 4: Link the Verification to the PrincipleNow, we need to formally link our new verification to the "Simplicity" principle it supports../ea\_cli.py link "principles/AP-001-simplicity.md" "verifications/V-001-simplicity-principle-is-verified-by-a-low-rule-count.md"

Output:Successfully linked 'principles/AP-001-simplicity.md' to 'verifications/V-001-...' (relation: verified\_by). üîó

Step 5: Confirm the LinkageYou can immediately see the result of your linkage by listing the principles. Notice that the LINKS TO count for AP-001-simplicity.md has increased../ea\_cli.py list principle

This confirms the relationship is now tracked in the principles/spec.yaml file.Visualizing the ArchitectureThe visualize command is a powerful feature for understanding the relationships between your artifacts. You can generate diagrams for a single artifact, a whole category, or the entire repository.Example 1: Visualize a Single Domain (Mermaid Graph)To see a graphical representation of the Business Architecture domain and its direct relationships, run:./ea\_cli.py visualize domains/D-001-business-architecture.md

This will output a Mermaid code block that you can paste into any Markdown viewer that supports it (like GitHub, GitLab, or VS Code with a Mermaid extension).Example 2: Visualize a Principle (Markdown List)To get a text-based, hierarchical list for the "Simplicity" principle, use the --format markdown flag. This is useful for quick navigation as the output contains clickable links../ea\_cli.py visualize principles/AP-001-simplicity.md --format markdown

Output:\* \*\*Principle:\*\* \[AP-001-simplicity.md](principles/AP-001-simplicity.md)

&nbsp;   \* \*Supported By Rules:\*

&nbsp;       \* \*\*Rule:\*\* \[AR-002-modular.md](rules/AR-002-modular.md)

&nbsp;   \* \*Verified By:\*

&nbsp;       \* \*\*Verification:\*\* \[V-001-simplicity-principle-is-verified-by-a-low-rule-count.md](verifications/V-001-simplicity-principle-is-verified-by-a-low-rule-count.md)

Example 3: Visualize All PrinciplesYou can generate a single diagram showing all principles and their connections by using the --type option../ea\_cli.py visualize --type principle

Example 4: Visualize the Entire ArchitectureTo get a complete, top-down view of your entire architecture, use --type all. This starts from the domains and maps out all their descendant principles and rules../ea\_cli.py visualize --type all --depth 3

How Validation WorksThe validate all command is a crucial tool for maintaining the integrity of your repository. It performs a series of checks in order:Scans Directories: It iterates through each artifact directory (domains/, principles/, etc.).Compares Files to Spec: It compares the list of .md files on the disk with the entries in that directory's spec.yaml file to find:Untracked files: Files that exist on disk but are not registered in spec.yaml.Missing files: Files that are registered in spec.yaml but have been deleted from the disk.Checks Links: It goes through every link in every spec.yaml file and verifies that the target file actually exists, flagging any broken links.Validates Content (If Configured): If a \_\_config\_\_ section with validation\_rules is found in a spec.yaml, it reads the content of each markdown file in that directory and tests it against the specified rules.Demonstrating a Validation FailureTo see how the validator catches errors, let's intentionally introduce a few problems:Create an untracked file:touch rules/AR-999-untracked-rule.md

Break a link: The "Agility" principle (AP-003) is linked to the "Scaleable" rule (AR-004). Let's delete the rule file without unlinking it first.rm rules/AR-004-scaleable.md

Violate a content rule: Edit the domains/D-001-business-architecture.md file and remove the text from the ## Purpose section, leaving it blank.Now, run the validator:./ea\_cli.py validate all

Expected Error Output:Running all validation checks...



--- Validating Directory: 'principles' ---

&nbsp; \[ERROR] Broken link: 'AP-003-agility.md' points to non-existent file 'rules/AR-004-scaleable.md'.



--- Validating Directory: 'rules' ---

&nbsp; \[ERROR] Untracked file: 'rules/AR-999-untracked-rule.md' is on disk but not in spec.yaml.



--- Validating Directory: 'domains' ---

&nbsp; \[ERROR] Content error in 'D-001-business-architecture.md': The '## Purpose' section must contain at least one bullet point.



--- Validating Directory: 'verifications' ---



Validation complete. Found 3 error(s). ‚ùå

This output clearly identifies each problem, telling you exactly what needs to be fixed to bring the repository back into a compliant state.Extending Validation with spec.yamlYou can enforce content standards for your artifacts by adding custom rules to the spec.yaml file. This is done inside a special \_\_config\_\_ block.Each rule requires two properties:pattern: A Python-compatible regular expression (regex) to test against the file's content.description: The error message to display if the pattern is not found.Example: Enforcing the 'Purpose' Section in DomainsLet's ensure that every domain's markdown file has a non-empty "Purpose" section.Open domains/spec.yaml.Add a validation\_rules block inside the \_\_config\_\_ section.\_\_config\_\_:

&nbsp; template: |

&nbsp;   # {prefix}: {title}

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   ## Purpose

&nbsp;   - {description}



&nbsp;   ## Scope

&nbsp;   - <...>



&nbsp;   ## Stakeholders

&nbsp;   - <...>

&nbsp; # Add this new section

&nbsp; validation\_rules:

&nbsp;   purpose\_exists:

&nbsp;     description: The '## Purpose' section must contain at least one bullet point.

&nbsp;     pattern: '## Purpose\\n\\n- .+'

How this regex works:## Purpose\\n\\n: Matches the heading "## Purpose" followed by two newlines.- .+: Matches a line that starts with a hyphen and a space (- ), followed by one or more characters (.+).Now, if you create or edit a domain file and leave the Purpose section empty, running ./ea\_cli.py validate all will produce a specific, actionable error message.Command ReferenceFor detailed help on any command, use the --help flag. Example: ./ea\_cli.py create --helpinit: Sets up a new, populated EA repository.list <type>: Lists all artifacts of a given type.show <type> <filename>: Shows details for one artifact.create <type> <title>: Creates a new artifact.update <path>: Updates metadata (e.g., --moscow Must).delete <path>: Deletes an artifact.link <source\_path> <target\_path>: Links two artifacts.unlink <source\_path> <target\_path>: Removes a link.visualize \[path] \[--type <type|all>]: Generates relationship diagrams.validate all: Checks the integrity of the repository.
