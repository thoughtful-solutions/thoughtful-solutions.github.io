# AR: Documented

All architectural decisions, configurations, and dependencies must be documented in a standardized, searchable format. Documentation must include rationale for decisions, integration points, and operational procedures. This ensures knowledge transfer, reduces single-person dependencies, and enables informed decision-making.
